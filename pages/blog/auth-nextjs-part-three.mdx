## **Introduction**

Hello and welcome to my blog! This post is part 3 out of 5 in a series where I cover how to use Next.Js, MongoDB, and TypeScript together all with out a server.

Today in part 3, I'm going to be demonstrating how an npm module called [Mongoose](https://mongoosejs.com/) can build a connection instance for NextJs serverless functions. The connection instance is re-useable & maps out to a single Mongo database. This was tricky at first because it required a more simplistic approach than what im used to with Express.

## **A Quick Look at Mongoose**

I introduced MongoDB Atlas in [part one](https://www.anthonygayflor.com) and gave a brief overview about what it is and how were using it in the template. To put it shortly, MongoDB is a NoSql, aka non-relational, database that stores data in BSON format as documents. The issue is that when working with mongoDB outside the terminal, saving data can get tricky.

Thats why we use Mongoose instead to help us out. Mongoose is a schema-based solution used to model application data after and save them as documents within MongoDB. Click [here](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/models.html) to learn more about Mongoose.

## **Getting Started**

If you're interested in the code here the [Github repo](https://github.com/anthonyg56/NextJs-Typescript-Serverless-Template) you can check out for your self.

Before getting started on the code, let setup the project with files containing mainly code for Mongoose. We need to create 3 new files and 1 new folder. Inside of the root of the project directory, go ahead and add

- A File called `iModels.ts` inside of `/interfaces`
- A Folder at the root called `models`, and a new file inside of it called `user.schema.js`
- Another File called `withDb.ts` inside of `/utils`

Now install the two npm modules we will be needing, in your console add these two packages to your project

> $ npm i mongoose bcrypt

then run this command right after to install their type dependcencies.

> $ npm i --save-dev @types/mongoose @types/bcrypt

bcrypt is a library to help you hash passwords. To learn more, click [here](https://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js) to view its repository and documentation.

## **Connect to MongoDB without A Server**

From personal experience, learning how to use Mongoose with out a Node.js framework like express was a big challange. At the time Im still transitioning from working primarilly on the front-end and starting to understand a Nuxt codebase Im building that uses Express & MongoDB. 

Just when I thought that I had started to understand navigating the backend better, trying to learn how to use mongoose with out express & Nuxt boilerplates to guide me was a big reality check I'm still just figuring things out. 

After alot of debugging and googling, I was able to grasp that Mongoose can create a reuseable connection instance & it maps to a single database in MongoDB. This means that when working with Mongoose inside of a serverless architecture, one connection instance can be imported into multiple serverless functions.

### **Creating a Mongoose Connection üêæ**
![Mongoose Connecting](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2F66.media.tumblr.com%2Fae45cb8a7fb817ae9b00601d06373f78%2Ftumblr_oeunuubnKg1qfthy3o1_1280.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

Inside of `./utils/withDb.ts`, import these packages from mongoose

```typescript
import { createConnection, Connection, ConnectionOptions } from "mongoose"
```

**`createConnection(uri, options)`** is a asynchronous function that takes two arguments and returns a Promise with a Connection Instance. 

For the first argument `uri` is the connection string needed to connect to MongoDB Atlas. Currently it issaved as an enviorment variable and to access it just refrence `process.env.MONGO_URI`. The second argument `options` is an object that contains optional properties to configure for the connection. 

Copy and paste the rest of the code into `withDb.ts`

```typescript
let conn: any = null

const MONGO_URI = process.env.MONGO_URI as string

const DbOptions: ConnectionOptions = {
  useNewUrlParser: true,
  useUnifiedTopology: true,
  useCreateIndex: true,
  useFindAndModify: true
}

export const getConnection = async (): Promise<Connection> => {
  if (conn === null) {
    conn = await createConnection(MONGO_URI, DbOptions)
  }
  return conn
}
```

In order to re-use the connection, `getConnection()` has to first check if there is a Connection that is being used already. If there is then that instance is returned, otherwise a new one is created and then returned. Nothing too difficult to understand.

## **Creating the User Model**

To create a document in MongoDB with mongoose, we first need to create schemas that are basically the blueprint of a model. A model is a fancy constructor that is defined by a schema and is used to create a instance of a MongoDB document. When ever we save a model, its gets stored as a document in MongoDb.

If this is your first time using Mongoose, It's really similar to creating an object so it shouldn't be too difficult to grasp.

### **Model Interfaces**

We need to create a type interface that will be reused multiples times. Inside of `/interfaces`, create a new file called `iModels.ts`. This file is where all models type related code will be stored. Inside of iModels.ts copy and paste the following code.

```typescript
import { Document } from 'mongoose'

export interface iUser extends Document {
    name: string,
    userName: string,
    email: string,
    password: string
}
```

The iUser interface takes 4 properties that looks exactly like the inital state seen [part two](https://www.anthonygayflor.com) in the register form. Thats because when a user registers for an account, the data gets sent to be saved with a Model defined by Mongoose. Before the User model is used, TypeScript double checks that the data matches the iUser interface.

### **Defining the Schema**

In order to save a user into MongoDB, there needs to be a defined Mongoose Schema that is exported as a Model. To learn more about how to define a schema, check out the Mongoose [docs](https://mongoosejs.com/docs/guide.html). 

Copy and paste the User Schema into `./models/user.schema.ts`

```typescript
import mongoose, { Model, Connection, Schema } from 'mongoose'
import { iUser } from '../../interfaces/iModels'

const schemaName = 'User'
const UserSchema: Schema<iUser> = new Schema<iUser>({
    name: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    },
    userName: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        index: {
            unique: true
        }
    },
    email: {
        type: String,
        required: true,
        index: {
            unique: true
        }
    },
    password: {
        type: String,
        required: true
    }
})
```

First all packages containing instances and types definitions for the UserModel is imported, then two variables are defined. `schemaName` is just a string containing the name of the Schema & `UserSchema` represents an instance of the Schema class. UserSchema has 4 properties all of types string and are all required inorder for a new User Document to be created.

Properties userName & email must be unique and require an index but thats not important at all right now. 

The general outline of the user schema is now defined, but for extra security there needs to be a method for hashing user passwords.

### **Hashing User Passwords**

Before a new document is saved into MongoDB with the User Model, the password needs to be hashed and override the old one. To do this were going to run `bcrypt` at the *pre save* of saving a document because Mongoose allows defined pre save methods that act as a middle ware before executing saving a model. The pre save method is defined in the Mongoose schema before a model is created. 

At the tops of `user.schema.ts`, below the two imports add these two lines of code.

```typescript
import bcrypt from 'bcrypt'

const SALT_WORK_FACTOR = 10
```

We need to import bcrypt and use it to encrypt the User Schemas password on pre save, and use  `SALT_WORK_FACTOR` as the rounds defined to generate a salt. Copy the User Schema pre save function and paste it before UserSchema.

```typescript
UserSchema.pre<IUser>('save', function(next) {
    const user = this

    /* Only hash the password if it has been modified, or is new */
    if (!user.isModified('password')) {
      return next()
    }
  
    /* Generate a salt */
    bcrypt.genSalt(SALT_WORK_FACTOR, function(err, salt) {
      if (err) {
        return next(err)
      }

      /* Hash the password along with our new salt */
      bcrypt.hash(user.password, salt, function(err, hash) {
        if (err) {
          return next(err)
        }
        /* override the cleartext password with the hashed one*/
        user.password = hash

        next()
      })
    })
})
```

At pre-save, the User Model only hashes a password if its being modified otherwise next is returned and the save process continues. In order to hash a passsword, a salt is generate with `genSalt` that uses the `SALT_WORK_FACTOR` defined at the top, hashes the user password and saves creates a new password containing the has. After its all done, User Continues saving.

### **UserSchema to UserModel**

The UserSchema is now defined and can be exported as a Mongoose model. Copy and paste this code at the bottom of `user.schema.ts` and of course save all your hard work.

```typescript
const UserModel = (con: Connection): Model<IUser> => con.model<IUser>(schemaName, UserSchema)

export default UserModel
```

Here we see that UserModel takes a Connection instance as an argument and returns a Model instance that is created on the Connection instance. I'm sure there will be a hook for it here soon enough.

Ah, just joking.

## **Wrapping it up**

The database connection & document models are all set up and ready to be used within the application. In the part [four](https://anthonygayflor.comhttps://github.com/kelektiv/node.bcrypt.js), I'll introduce my favorite feature included an any framework, Next.Js 9 Api routes & show how to manage Route calling without a custom server. 

Until then, once again, thank you for your time and ill catch you in the *next* part üòº
