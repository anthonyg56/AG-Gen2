                        <p>My name's Anthony Gayflor, and I'm a freelance web developer from Indianapolis, IN. Web development is how I utilize a passion for creativity, innovation, and problem solving; helping brands and individuals turn a vision into a reality. I write code that gives clients power over their own websites, offering the full-range of customization found in traditional websites, combined with the more modern experience of a content management system (or CMS) such as Wordpress. The products I develop are user-friendly, simple to manage, professionally designed, and quick in the browser. I work closely and purposefully with my clients, with the intentions of being an asset to their bussiness & its' growth.</p>
